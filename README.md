> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Spequoia is currently in active development and not yet production-ready. We welcome contributions! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

## Features

### üé® Design-First Approach

- Human-readable specifications using Markdown syntax
- Interactive wireframe generation for early UI visualization
- Stakeholder-friendly documentation

### üîÑ Development Integration

- Single source of truth for application behavior
- Seamless repository integration
- Reduced knowledge duplication
- Synchronized specifications and code

### ‚úÖ Testing Made Easy

- Automated end-to-end test generation
- Example-driven test cases
- Built-in test runner
- Behavior verification against specifications

### üìñ Documentation Generation

- Automatic documentation from specifications
- Interactive demos
- Always up-to-date documentation
- Built-in documentation generator

## Extensibility

While Spequoia comes with built-in tools, it's designed to be extensible through its well-documented schema. Third-party developers can create additional tooling to enhance or customize Spequoia's capabilities:

- Alternative test runners (e.g., Selenium, Cypress, TestCafe)
- Custom documentation generators
- Different wireframe rendering engines
- IDE plugins and extensions
- CI/CD integrations
- Design tool exporters/importers
- Analytics and reporting tools
- Custom validation rules

The specification format is technology-agnostic, allowing for implementations across various platforms and frameworks.

## Development Lifecycle Integration

Spequoia supports the entire software development lifecycle:

1. **Design Phase**: Create specifications and animated wireframes
2. **Development**: Use specifications as source of truth
3. **Testing**: Generate and run end-to-end tests
4. **Documentation**: Auto-generate interactive documentation
