title: TODO app
description: |
  This application is a web application in vanilla JS that
  allows you to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

  The tasks are stored in local storage as a JSON object.

  ## Local storage

  The local storage is a JSON object with a list of tasks (`tasks`).

  Each task has a UUID, a title, a creation date, and a boolean `done` property.

  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "tasks": [
      {
        "id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
        "title": "Task 1",
        "createdAt": "2025-04-12T18:34:06.000Z",
        "done": false
      },
      {
        "id": "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
        "title": "Task 2",
        "createdAt": "2025-04-12T18:34:56.000Z",
        "done": true
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## UI

  The web-app displays as a minimalistic HTML page that consists
  of a header with the app title "My TODO".

  The main section displays a task creation form and the list of tasks.

  The task creation form consists of a text input for the task name
  and a "Add" button.

  Tasks are displayed in a list with the following properties:

  - title: the task title, striked through when task is completed
  - done: a checkbox that marks the task as done

  Tasks are ordered by descending creation date. Done tasks are displayed last.

  Clicking the done checkbox updates the done status of a task.
