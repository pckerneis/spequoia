  # TODO MVC

  This document is an example **Spequoia** specification for a TODO app.

  It's based on the [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) project, which provides a
  consistent way to implement a simple TODO app using various JavaScript frameworks.

  ![TodoMVC](player-data/EX-007/32.png "TodoMVC")

  The goal of this document is to show how to use **Spequoia** to specify the
  behavior of a web application. It includes the following sections:
  - **Views**: The user interface of the application, including the layout and
      elements used.
  - **Features**: The features of the application.
  - **Examples**: The examples of the features, including the expected
      behavior and the steps to reproduce it.

  These sections are used to generate wireframes, test cases, and documentation.
